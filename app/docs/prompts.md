write a complete python web app using streamlit wit the following components:

* a backend metrics import routine. The routine must append new metrics to a common file or database. The choice is up to you.
* the backend should take multiple org names and merge all the metrics adding a property to keep track of the org
* a front end that allows to show the following information:
  * a slecter for the timeframe for the data to show
  * a selectors for orgs, models, editor and language
  * the number of active users and incative users in the period
  * the number of accpeted lines of code and the % on the suggestions made

#Answer
Areas for Improvement
Duplicate Files: You have both 1_charts.py and 1_Charts.py (case difference). This can cause issues on case-insensitive file systems and create confusion.

Inconsistent Import Paths: Some files use relative imports (from utils.helpers) while others use different import styles. Consistency would improve maintainability.

Page Naming Convention: Using numeric prefixes (1_charts.py) works but Streamlit now supports a pages/ directory with automatic navigation. Consider standardizing your approach.

Duplicate Database Import Button: In _loader.py, you have two "Import Data" buttons that perform the same action.

Error Handling: Add more robust error handling around database operations and API calls.

Missing Requirements: Your requirements.txt should pin specific versions for better reproducibility (e.g., streamlit==1.32.0 instead of just streamlit).

Session State Management: Session state variables are scattered across different files. Consider centralizing this logic.

Recommendations
Standardize Page Structure: Use a consistent template for all pages with standard imports and authentication requirements.

Refactor Authentication Flow: The current authentication implementation seems to have some issues. Consider creating a more robust auth module.

Add Documentation: Add docstrings to functions and modules for better code maintainability.

Implement Logging: Replace print statements with proper logging to help with debugging.

Cache Heavy Operations: Use @st.cache_data or @st.cache_resource decorators for database queries and API calls.

Add Tests: Consider adding unit tests for your utility functions and data processing logic.

Secrets Management: Use Streamlit's secrets management instead of directly accessing environment variables where possible.

Use a Database Abstraction Layer: Consider using an ORM like SQLAlchemy to make database operations more maintainable.
