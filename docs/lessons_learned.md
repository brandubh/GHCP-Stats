better one shot generation than getting to the complete code stpe by step
better focus generation on a spcecific framework
use copilot-instrcutions.md to set your workspace rules
enable [experimantal feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_reusable-prompt-files-experimental) to have a prompts library to reference in 

while o3-mini has the best score in coding, I preferred Sonnet 3.7

Documentation generation is prone to hallucinations if using @workspace or @github, graouding on specific files performs better?
