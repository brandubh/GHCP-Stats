# Security

## Authentication Methods

GHCP-Stats implements multiple authentication methods to secure access to the system.

### OAuth 2.0 with GitHub

The primary authentication method integrates with GitHub's OAuth 2.0 implementation:

1. **Authorization Flow**:
   - User initiates login through the web interface.
   - System redirects to GitHub OAuth authorization endpoint.
   - User authenticates with GitHub credentials.
   - GitHub redirects back with authorization code.
   - System exchanges code for access token.
   - System verifies token and creates session.

2. **Scope Requirements**:
   - `read:user`: For basic profile information.
   - `user:email`: For email address access.
   - `repo`: For repository access (optional, based on features).
   - `read:org`: For organization membership validation.

3. **Token Management**:
   - Access tokens stored in encrypted format.
   - Refresh tokens used to maintain long-term access.
   - Token rotation implemented for security.
   - Token revocation on logout or suspicious activity.

### API Key Authentication

For automated systems and integrations:

1. **Key Generation**:
   - Generated through admin interface.
   - Scoped to specific resources and operations.
   - Time-limited with configurable expiration.

2. **Key Validation**:
   - Transmitted via `Authorization` header.
   - Rate-limited to prevent abuse.
   - Validated against database of active keys.

3. **Key Lifecycle**:
   - Regular rotation enforced (30/60/90 day cycles).
   - Audit trail for key creation and usage.
   - Emergency revocation capability.

## Authorization Model

The system implements a role-based access control (RBAC) model with attribute-based refinements.

### Core Roles

| Role           | Description                  | Capabilities                              |
|----------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Administrator  | System-wide administration  | Full access to all features and configuration |
| Team Manager   | Manages team settings and access | Access to team data and configuration    |
| Analyst        | Views and analyzes data      | Read-only access to dashboards and reports |
| Developer      | Individual user              | Access to personal data and team-shared resources |
| Integration    | Automated systems            | API access for data collection and integration |

### Permission Structure

Permissions are structured hierarchically:

```
- system.*
  - system.config.*
    - system.config.read
    - system.config.write
  - system.users.*
    - system.users.read
    - system.users.create
    - system.users.update
    - system.users.delete
- teams.*
  - teams.create
  - teams.read
  - teams.update
  - teams.delete
  - teams.members.*
    - teams.members.add
    - teams.members.remove
- projects.*
  - projects.create
  - projects.read
  - projects.update
  - projects.delete
- data.*
  - data.collect
  - data.read.*
    - data.read.personal
    - data.read.team
    - data.read.project
    - data.read.system
  - data.export.*
    - data.export.personal
    - data.export.team
    - data.export.project
```

### Access Control Enforcement

Access control is enforced at multiple layers:

1. **API Gateway**: Validates authentication and basic authorization.
2. **Service Layer**: Applies business-specific authorization rules.
3. **Data Layer**: Implements fine-grained access control for sensitive data.

## Secrets Management

GHCP-Stats employs robust secrets management practices to protect sensitive information:

1. **Environment Variables**: Secrets such as API keys and database credentials are stored in environment variables.
2. **Encryption**: Secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit using industry-standard algorithms.
3. **Access Control**: Secrets are accessible only to authorized services and personnel.
4. **Rotation Policies**: Regular rotation of secrets to minimize exposure risk.
5. **Audit Logging**: All access to secrets is logged for auditing purposes.

## Security Testing

The system undergoes rigorous security testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities:

1. **Static Code Analysis**: Automated tools scan the codebase for security issues.
2. **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Simulates attacks on the running application to identify vulnerabilities.
3. **Penetration Testing**: Security experts perform manual testing to uncover complex vulnerabilities.
4. **Dependency Scanning**: Identifies and updates vulnerable third-party libraries.
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitors for new vulnerabilities and applies patches promptly.
