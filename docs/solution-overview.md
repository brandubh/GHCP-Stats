# Solution Overview

## High-Level Overview

GHCP-Stats is a Streamlit-based analytics platform designed to provide insights into GitHub Copilot usage across organizations. The solution leverages the GitHub Copilot API to retrieve usage metrics, processes this information to extract meaningful insights, and presents the results through interactive visualizations in a web dashboard.

The system operates as a three-tier architecture:
1. **Data Retrieval Layer**: Interfaces with the GitHub Copilot API to gather organizational usage metrics.
2. **Processing Layer**: Transforms, aggregates, and filters the collected data using Pandas.
3. **Presentation Layer**: Delivers insights through an interactive Streamlit web dashboard.

## Core Functionality Explanation

### Data Collection
The application retrieves data from the GitHub Copilot API, including:
- Active user counts
- Suggestions statistics (total, accepted)
- Language-specific metrics
- Repository-level data
- Organization-wide adoption metrics

The API integration is optimized to handle rate limits appropriately and implements caching to improve performance.

### Data Processing
The data processing engine:
- Aggregates metrics across specified time periods
- Filters data based on user selections (date ranges, repositories, languages)
- Calculates derived metrics (acceptance rates, usage trends)
- Prepares data structures for visualization components

The implementation uses Pandas DataFrames for efficient data manipulation and SQLite for persistent storage of historical data.

### Reporting and Visualization
The Streamlit-based presentation layer provides:
- Interactive dashboards with filterable metrics
- Trend analysis visualizations showing adoption over time
- Comparative views across repositories and programming languages
- Downloadable data in CSV format for further analysis

## User Workflows

### Administrator Workflow
1. Authenticate with Azure AD credentials.
2. Configure GitHub API access tokens.
