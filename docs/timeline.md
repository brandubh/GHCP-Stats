# Timing

Project timing in software development is an important KPI for assessing development velocity. When comparing traditional approaches to modern development methods like Copilot-assisted coding, these metrics become particularly valuable. While coding speed is inherently subjective and heavily dependent on factors such as code quality, documentation, and test coverage, it provides useful benchmarks. For comparison, when I asked my development team to build an internal MVP v1 deployed on Azure using traditional methods, their estimate was 80 working hours.
