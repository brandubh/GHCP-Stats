# Exploring

## 1st exploring prompt

You are an experienced Python developers that give advice and recommendations on solution architectures.
I want to create an application that:

- reads github copilot metrics from the github API
- saves the data in a database
plots several filtered charts for the user to navigate and analyze data.
I want:
- the application to be written in python
- it must be easy to run locally
- UI complexity is not a must.

Analyze the available python frameworks and suggest the best one to be used for this project.

### Optimized prompt

I need recommendations for building a Python application that analyzes GitHub Copilot usage metrics. The application should:

1. Fetch Copilot metrics from GitHub's API
2. Store this data in a database
3. Generate interactive, filterable data visualizations

Requirements:

- Must be written in Python
- Easy local setup (minimal dependencies/configuration)
- Simple UI is acceptable - functionality over aesthetics
- Should support common analysis patterns (usage trends, feature adoption, etc.)

Please evaluate 3-4 Python framework combinations for this project, considering:

- Data fetching capabilities (API clients)
- Database options (SQL vs NoSQL, ORM support)
- Visualization libraries
- UI framework options

For your top recommendation, provide:

- A basic architecture diagram/description
- Key packages/dependencies
- Sample code structure
- Potential challenges and their solutions

### Answers

Sonnet 3.7
Recommendation: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL + Plotly Dash
This combination offers the best balance of modern development practices, scalability, and visualization capabilities while maintaining reasonable complexity.

Gemini 2.0
Top Recommendation: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Streamlit + httpx

GTP-4o
Top Recommendation: Flask + SQLAlchemy + Plotly/Dash

o3-mini
Top Recommendation: Flask + SQLAlchemy + Dash

o1
FastAPI + SQLModel + Plotly/Dash (Recommended)
Why: FastAPI is lightweight, asynchronous, and easy to debug locally. SQLModel simplifies SQLAlchemy usage. Dash integrates seamlessly with Plotly for interactive data apps.

write a complete python web app using streamlit with the following components:

- a backend metrics import routine. The routine must append new metrics to a common file or database. The choice is up to you.
- the backend should take multiple org names and merge all the metrics adding a property to keep track of the org
- a front end that allows to show the following information:
  - a selector for the timeframe for the data to show
  - a selectors for orgs, models, editor and language
  - the number of active users and incative users in the period
  - the number of accepted lines of code and the % on the suggestions made

# Deployment

Give me a detailed guide to deploy the resulting streamlit solution on Azure, considering the following:
- a container app should be the first choice
- persist the data in sqllite database between runs and let it be updated by the scheduled import data tasks
- use keyvault for the secrets
- the app must be authenticated using entra id identities. add the required login logic.
- detail the steps to register the app for authentication on a specific entra id tenant

# Other Prompts

## Best practices

Areas for Improvement
Duplicate Files: You have both 1_charts.py and 1_Charts.py (case difference). This can cause issues on case-insensitive file systems and create confusion.

Inconsistent Import Paths: Some files use relative imports (from utils.helpers) while others use different import styles. Consistency would improve maintainability.

Page Naming Convention: Using numeric prefixes (1_charts.py) works but Streamlit now supports a pages/ directory with automatic navigation. Consider standardizing your approach.

Duplicate Database Import Button: In _loader.py, you have two "Import Data" buttons that perform the same action.

Error Handling: Add more robust error handling around database operations and API calls.

Missing Requirements: Your requirements.txt should pin specific versions for better reproducibility (e.g., streamlit==1.32.0 instead of just streamlit).

Session State Management: Session state variables are scattered across different files. Consider centralizing this logic.

Recommendations
Standardize Page Structure: Use a consistent template for all pages with standard imports and authentication requirements.

Refactor Authentication Flow: The current authentication implementation seems to have some issues. Consider creating a more robust auth module.

Add Documentation: Add docstrings to functions and modules for better code maintainability.

Implement Logging: Replace print statements with proper logging to help with debugging.

Cache Heavy Operations: Use @st.cache_data or @st.cache_resource decorators for database queries and API calls.

Add Tests: Consider adding unit tests for your utility functions and data processing logic.

Secrets Management: Use Streamlit's secrets management instead of directly accessing environment variables where possible.

Use a Database Abstraction Layer: Consider using an ORM like SQLAlchemy to make database operations more maintainable.

give me a step by step guide to remotely debug a streamlit application deployed in azure ACA from Visual Studio Code. Be prescriptive, include any code or configuration needed

tuning azure deployment to include frontdoor, the real issue is the ACA choice, it seems this Azure service deserve some polishing
