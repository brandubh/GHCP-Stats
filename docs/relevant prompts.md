# Exploring

## 1st exploring prompt

You are an experienced Python developers that give advice and recommendations on solution architectures.
I want to create an application that:

- reads github copilot metrics from the github API
- saves the data in a database
plots several filtered charts for the user to navigate and analyze data.
I want:
- the application to be written in python
- it must be easy to run locally
- UI complexity is not a must.

Analyze the available python frameworks and suggest the best one to be used for this project.

### Optimized prompt

I need recommendations for building a Python application that analyzes GitHub Copilot usage metrics. The application should:

1. Fetch Copilot metrics from GitHub's API
2. Store this data in a database
3. Generate interactive, filterable data visualizations

Requirements:

- Must be written in Python
- Easy local setup (minimal dependencies/configuration)
- Simple UI is acceptable - functionality over aesthetics
- Should support common analysis patterns (usage trends, feature adoption, etc.)

Please evaluate 3-4 Python framework combinations for this project, considering:

- Data fetching capabilities (API clients)
- Database options (SQL vs NoSQL, ORM support)
- Visualization libraries
- UI framework options

For your top recommendation, provide:

- A basic architecture diagram/description
- Key packages/dependencies
- Sample code structure
- Potential challenges and their solutions

### Answers

Sonnet 3.7
Recommendation: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL + Plotly Dash
This combination offers the best balance of modern development practices, scalability, and visualization capabilities while maintaining reasonable complexity.

Gemini 2.0
Top Recommendation: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Streamlit + httpx

GTP-4o
Top Recommendation: Flask + SQLAlchemy + Plotly/Dash

o3-mini
Top Recommendation: Flask + SQLAlchemy + Dash

o1
FastAPI + SQLModel + Plotly/Dash (Recommended)
Why: FastAPI is lightweight, asynchronous, and easy to debug locally. SQLModel simplifies SQLAlchemy usage. Dash integrates seamlessly with Plotly for interactive data apps.

write a complete python web app using streamlit with the following components:

- a backend metrics import routine. The routine must append new metrics to a common file or database. The choice is up to you.
- the backend should take multiple org names and merge all the metrics adding a property to keep track of the org
- a front end that allows to show the following information:
  - a selector for the timeframe for the data to show
  - a selectors for orgs, models, editor and language
  - the number of active users and incative users in the period
  - the number of accepted lines of code and the % on the suggestions made

# Deployment

Give me a detailed guide to deploy the resulting streamlit solution on Azure, considering the following:

- a container app should be the first choice
- persist the data in sqllite database between runs and let it be updated by the scheduled import data tasks
- use keyvault for the secrets
- the app must be authenticated using entra id identities. add the required login logic.
- detail the steps to register the app for authentication on a specific entra id tenant

# Best practices

@workspace check my app folder for best practices in a streamlit project

## Answer

Areas for Improvement
Duplicate Files: You have both 1_charts.py and 1_Charts.py (case difference). This can cause issues on case-insensitive file systems and create confusion.

Inconsistent Import Paths: Some files use relative imports (from utils.helpers) while others use different import styles. Consistency would improve maintainability.

Page Naming Convention: Using numeric prefixes (1_charts.py) works but Streamlit now supports a pages/ directory with automatic navigation. Consider standardizing your approach.

Duplicate Database Import Button: In _loader.py, you have two "Import Data" buttons that perform the same action.

Error Handling: Add more robust error handling around database operations and API calls.

Missing Requirements: Your requirements.txt should pin specific versions for better reproducibility (e.g., streamlit==1.32.0 instead of just streamlit).

Session State Management: Session state variables are scattered across different files. Consider centralizing this logic.

Recommendations
Standardize Page Structure: Use a consistent template for all pages with standard imports and authentication requirements.

Refactor Authentication Flow: The current authentication implementation seems to have some issues. Consider creating a more robust auth module.

Add Documentation: Add docstrings to functions and modules for better code maintainability.

Implement Logging: Replace print statements with proper logging to help with debugging.

Cache Heavy Operations: Use @st.cache_data or @st.cache_resource decorators for database queries and API calls.

Add Tests: Consider adding unit tests for your utility functions and data processing logic.

Secrets Management: Use Streamlit's secrets management instead of directly accessing environment variables where possible.

Use a Database Abstraction Layer: Consider using an ORM like SQLAlchemy to make database operations more maintainable.

# Workaournd for the SQLLite bug with Azure File Share

The current implementation of SQLLite whem implemented in Azure ACA with Azure File Share as permamnt storage doesn't work. SQLLite is not supported in such an environment.
I want you to edit the code to:

* every time the import_metrics is called it first get a copy of the metrics.db from the azure file share persistent storage. use an environment variable to track this location
* import the metrics in the db
* copy back the metrics.db to file storage
if needed add or chnage the environemnt avriables required.

1st try with only import_ghcp.py in scope
1nd try with also helpers.py in scope

GPT-4o has different behavior based on context and implements the entire logic in helper.py not taking into consideration the need of local run.
Sonnet 3.7 has a more comprehensive approach, taking into consideration Azure and non Azure environments

_I want you to REWRITE the following prompt optimizing it for Github Copilot:_

## Prompt rewritten by Sonnet 3.7

/**

* PROBLEM:
* SQLite doesn't work properly in Azure Container Apps (ACA) with Azure File Share as persistent storage
* due to file locking and concurrent access issues.
*
* TASK:
* Modify the import_metrics function to implement a "copy-work-save" pattern:
*
* 1. Copy metrics.db from Azure File Share to local container storage
* 2. Perform database operations locally
* 3. Copy the updated database back to Azure File Share
*
* REQUIREMENTS:
* * Use environment variable (AZ_FILE_SHARE_PATH) to locate the persistent storage
* * Handle cases where the database doesn't exist yet
* * Add proper error handling and logging
* * Ensure atomic operations to prevent data corruption
* * Add type hints and documentation
*
* IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
* * Use tempfile for secure temporary storage
* * Use shutil.copy2 to preserve file metadata
* * Properly close database connections
* * Handle race conditions
*
* ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
* * AZ_FILE_SHARE_PATH: Path to the mounted Azure File Share
* * METRICS_DB_FILENAME: Optional filename for the database (default: "metrics.db")

## Prompt rewritten by GPT4-o

 Here’s the rewritten prompt optimized for GitHub Copilot:

Prompt:
The current implementation of SQLite does not work when deployed in Azure Container Apps (ACA) with Azure File Share as persistent storage because SQLite is not supported in such an environment.

Update the code to achieve the following:

Fetch the database: Before calling import_metrics, retrieve a copy of metrics.db from the Azure File Share persistent storage. Use an environment variable to specify the file share location.
Import metrics: Perform the metrics import operation using the retrieved database.
Save changes: After the import, copy the updated metrics.db back to the Azure File Share persistent storage.
Environment variables: Add or modify any required environment variables to support this functionality.
Ensure the code is efficient, handles errors gracefully, and adheres to Python best practices.

## Prompt rewritten by Gemini 2.0

The current application uses SQLite for its metrics database, which is stored on an Azure File Share for persistent storage within an Azure Container Apps (ACA) environment. This setup is known to be problematic due to SQLite's file locking mechanisms not being well-suited for network file systems.

I need you to modify the import_metrics function to ensure data integrity and persistence in this environment. Specifically:

Environment Variable: Introduce a new environment variable, AZURE_FILE_SHARE_METRICS_PATH, to store the full path to the metrics.db file on the Azure File Share. If it doesn't exist, create it.
Database Synchronization: Before importing metrics, the import_metrics function must:
Copy the metrics.db file from the Azure File Share (specified by AZURE_FILE_SHARE_METRICS_PATH) to a local temporary directory.
If the file doesn't exist in the Azure File Share, create an empty SQLite database locally.
Import Metrics: Proceed with the existing logic to import the new metrics into the local SQLite database.
Database Upload: After successfully importing the metrics, the import_metrics function must:
Copy the updated metrics.db file from the local temporary directory back to the Azure File Share location specified by AZURE_FILE_SHARE_METRICS_PATH.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to catch potential exceptions during file copy operations and database interactions. Log any errors encountered.
Temporary Directory: Use the tempfile module to create a secure temporary directory for the local database operations. Ensure this directory is cleaned up after the function completes, regardless of success or failure.
Code Changes: Provide the code modifications necessary to implement these steps within the import_metrics function. Include necessary imports and error handling.
Testing: Provide a basic test case to verify that the database is correctly synchronized with the Azure File Share after importing metrics.
Please provide the modified import_metrics function, any necessary helper functions, and the updated environment variable definition. Ensure the solution adheres to the provided coding guidelines, including type annotations, docstrings, and error handling.

## Prompt rewritten by 03-mini

The current implementation of SQLite in Azure ACA—with Azure File Share as persistent storage—fails because SQLite isn’t supported in this environment. Please update the code so that when the function import_metrics is invoked, it does the following:

Retrieves a copy of metrics.db from the Azure File Share (using an environment variable to specify its location).
Imports the metrics from the acquired database.
Copies the updated metrics.db back to the Azure File Share.
Also, adjust or add any necessary environment variables to support these changes.
