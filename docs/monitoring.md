# Monitoring

## Logging Strategy

GHCP-Stats implements a comprehensive logging system to track application behavior, performance, and errors.

### Log Levels

The system uses the following log levels, in order of increasing severity:

1. **TRACE**: Detailed information for debugging complex issues.
2. **DEBUG**: Information useful for troubleshooting.
3. **INFO**: General information about system operation.
4. **WARN**: Potential issues that don't prevent normal operation.
5. **ERROR**: Issues that prevent specific operations from completing.
6. **FATAL**: Critical issues that prevent system operation.

### Log Categories

Logs are organized into the following categories:

- **API**: Requests to the system's REST API.
- **Auth**: Authentication and authorization events.
- **Collector**: Data collection operations.
- **Processor**: Data processing and analysis events.
- **Database**: Database operations and performance.
- **System**: General system events and status.
- **Security**: Security-related events and potential threats.

### Log Format

Each log entry follows this JSON structure:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-07-21T18:25:43.511Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "category": "API",
  "message": "Request processed successfully",
  "context": {
    "requestId": "req-123456",
    "userId": "user-789",
    "endpoint": "/api/metrics/summary",
    "duration": 45
  },
  "tags": ["performance", "user-facing"]
}
```

### Log Storage

- **Short-term Storage**: Elasticsearch for recent logs (30 days).
- **Long-term Archive**: S3-compatible object storage for historical logs.
- **Rotation Policy**: Daily log rotation with compression.

## Monitoring Approach

The monitoring system provides real-time visibility into system health, performance, and usage.

### Key Metrics

The following metrics are collected and monitored:

#### System Health
- CPU utilization (per service).
- Memory usage (per service).
- Disk I/O and usage.
- Network throughput and latency.
- Service uptime and availability.

#### Application Performance
- Request latency (p50, p95, p99).
- Request throughput (requests per second).
- Error rate (percentage of failed requests).
- Database query performance.
- Cache hit/miss ratio.

#### Business Metrics
- Active users (daily, weekly, monthly).
- Data collection volume.
- Processing throughput.
- API usage by endpoint.

### Monitoring Tools

The monitoring stack includes:

- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage.
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards.
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing.
- **Kibana**: Log visualization and analysis.
- **Healthchecks**: Service health monitoring and alerting.

### Dashboard Organization

The monitoring dashboards are organized by audience and purpose:

1. **Executive Dashboard**: High-level system health and business metrics.
2. **Operational Dashboard**: Detailed system performance and resource utilization.
3. **Developer Dashboard**: Debugging information and application performance.
4. **Security Dashboard**: Authentication events and security-related metrics.

## Alert Mechanisms

The alerting system ensures that appropriate personnel are notified of critical issues.

### Alert Severity Levels

1. **Critical**: Requires immediate attention (24/7).
2. **High**: Requires attention during business hours.
3. **Medium**: Should be addressed in the next maintenance window.
4. **Low**: Informational, no immediate action required.

### Alert Channels

Alerts are delivered through multiple channels:

- **Slack**: Team channels for collaborative response.
- **Email**: For non-urgent notifications and summaries.
- **PagerDuty**: For on-call rotation and escalation.
- **SMS**: For critical alerts requiring immediate attention.

### Alert Rules

Examples of key alert rules:

| Metric | Threshold | Severity | Description |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Service Availability | < 99.9% | Critical | Any service instance is unreachable |
| API Error Rate | > 1% | High | Error rate exceeds normal threshold |
| Response Time | > 500ms (p95) | Medium | API responses are slower than expected |
| CPU Utilization | > 85% | Medium | System resources are near capacity |
| Disk Space | > 85% | Medium | Storage space is running low |
| Failed Authentication | > 10 in 5min | High | Potential security breach attempt |

### Alert Suppression and Grouping

To prevent alert fatigue:

- Similar alerts are grouped into incidents.
- Alerts during scheduled maintenance are suppressed.
- Flapping detection prevents repeated alerts for unstable conditions.
- Alert storm detection limits the number of simultaneous alerts.
