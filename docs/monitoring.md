# Monitoring

The project does not include a dedicated monitoring stack. When running locally Streamlit logs to the console. In Azure Container Apps, container logs can be sent to Azure Log Analytics for inspection.

For more advanced monitoring you can integrate Application Insights or another logging solution, but this is outside the scope of the repository.
